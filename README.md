## Description
This simple wallet application was created with privacy in mind, you enter your wallet private key to login, to find it's replaced by the wallet's public key and using the "Priv" send button transactions can be signed locally before being sent to the VFC Network, this function also serves as a good implementation example for implementing VF Cash in Web-Wallet's. Once a transaction is made, the Transaction Explorer will display the transaction.

Due to the project using Qt it's fairly simple to compile onto a range of different target platforms as listed above.
